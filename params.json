I'm working on them though!\r\n![Broken Kismet](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/156916780453855232/164501325705510913/unknown.png)\r\nReally hard at work on them.\r\n\r\n## I helped!\r\n- Apparently I did the special name badges for Blay09's EiraMoticons? I can't remember exactly, it was late at night.\r\n\r\n# Other Trash\r\nNothing yet worthwhile, but I have a few pieces of code in my [github repository](http://github.com/dustine). Basically unfinished projects or one-off experiments.\r\n\r\n# Weaknesses\r\nDon't send me links or anything related to [this](http://dustine.github.io/trap) if you want to hear of me again for the next week or so./\r\nNot because I'll hate you or something, I just know myself to not be able to resist to marathon everything about it yet again.",
